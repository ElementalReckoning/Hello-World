# Hello-World
This here is my first repository. It's a bit confusing. But I am going to figure it out.
I'm an Apprentice Carpenter from Portland, OR. Hoping to use some of my brain power to learn how to code and program.
It is Monday and I have Muay Thai and BJJ today. My network is absolute shit so I am currently unable to download the Xubuntu ISO, therefore, I can't do any work on The Odin Project. I need a Wi Fi booster but I don't have the cash. I have to do this all my own and it's frustrating. I will accomplish my goals and it they be taste so much sweeter knwing that I did it myself.
